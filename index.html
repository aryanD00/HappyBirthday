    Happy 18th birthday, my amazing friend! I can’t believe you’re officially an adult! It feels like just yesterday we were in class 8th C. You've grown into such an incredible person, with a heart of gold and a spirit that lights up any room. You’re not just a friend; you’re the most realist friend. I'm so grateful for your friendship and can't wait to see all the amazing things you'll accomplish in this new chapter of your life. Here's to many more years of laughter, adventures, and unforgettable memories together!
